##Movie Search
This single page app allows a user to search for any movie of his choice.

It will display the movies information including the title, director, rating, genre, and the movies poster.

If the user see's a movie that he/she likes, they can click a button to add it to their list of favorites.

Also, there is a button available that will show them their entire list of favorited movies.

If the user wishes to return and search for more movies, there is a button provided to return them to the search.
